Giving feedback after using iPhone 5S last 25 days. I ordered this phone on Amazon Diwali Dhamaka deal @ 29999. I got amazing deal with best price. It is brand new genuine apple iPhone in sealed box with accessories having apple India warranty. I did not have any problem till date.

I selected 1 day delivery and got it. The phone came packed in original Apple packing--exactly like it would be in any Apple store worldwide. I could set up the phone in 15 minutes and update to new IOS 8.3. I have other iphones and this one is for my son. We use the same Apple user ID so I don't have to buy the apps I have purchased earlier. My apps synced with iCloud and setting up the new phone for use is very easy. Would recommend all to buy the iphone 5s from Amazon.

Delivery: On time and good packing by sellers GadgetDirect and ThinkGeek.<br />Warranty: Checked the serial number on Apple site and no problem with 1 year warranty from the date I activated phone.<br /><br />Performance: 10/10<br />Stability: 9/10<br />Consistency: 10/10<br />Looks: 10/10<br />Sound: 9/10<br />Camera: 8/10<br />Design: 10/10<br />Privacy Control: 10/10<br />Battery Backup: 7/10<br />Compatibility: 2/10<br /><br />Overall: 8.5 out of 10.<br /><br />(+) Performance - Apple designs both hardware and software so even the seemingly ordinary specs deliver vertex of performance.<br />(+) Stability - No abnormal reboot or termination of applications. This phone doesn't hang.<br />(+) Consistency - What performance and stability you are getting today, it won't diminish with time. Your phone remains same after months and years.<br />(+) Looks - I have Space Grey color. The appearance is ineffable, I'd call it verbatim beauty.<br />(+) Sound - Crisp and clean. Speakers are loud enough without leaking the sound. Put it close to ears and you will hear delicate punches of bass!<br />(+) Camera - Don't expect SLR segment. Snaps in day and night both can be tagged on decent mark.<br />(+) Design - 4&#34; is business elegance. Comfortable to hold and operate by single hand. This could be last offering from Apple in 4&#34; segment.<br />(+) Privacy Control - One must factor that this phone delivers. No application can play stunts accessing any of your information without permission.<br />(+) Battery Backup - Around 22 hours with normal usage and WiFi on. Charging takes 2 hours.<br />(-) Compatibility - This is where new users need to think. You can't just connect a USB cable and copy files in a trice from PC. Peering with any other phone is not available. Apple talks with Apple devices or through safe passage of iTunes. However, these constraints only give Apple the matchless stability and security.<br /><br />Deficiencies:<br />Apple map is not accurate so download Google map which is a minute worth task. Siri is not fluent with Indian accent as Google voice but she tries to learn. The text keyboard has odd placement of period (.) key, it's in in numerics keypad which is bit tedious while composing emails and message. On few 32 GB handsets there may be a slight yellow tint. Apple support claims its just the color profile / variance and not an issue. Depends now on user if they get adjusted as it might make their color preference look better. I though opted a neutral one. Last, this is a very delicate gadget and need to be handled carefully or with protective covers. &#34;A drop can result exorbitant repair charges.&#34;<br /><br />Final Say:<br />This phone has the outstanding combination of consistent performance and appearance. If compatibility is not an issue then this phone by no means would let you down on the paid price. IOS 9 will enhance the performance further as it will be half the size of IOS 8.

This Apple iPhone 5s (Space Grey, 16GB) is same as described by amazon. It is factory unlock genuine product.<br />We need to activate the Apple iPhone 5s (Space Grey, 16GB) in order to use it, without activating it is not possible,so insert active NANO SIM and switch on the Apple iPhone 5s. as soon you switch on , it will ask for the activation, go though the steps, and enter valid apple ID to activate. after all procedure your Apple iPhone 5s will be activated, and your 1 year manufacturer warranty period will start. you can check online for Apple iPhone 5s warranty check.<br /><br />you can check your warranty after activation using below link<br />https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do

Its awsome phone , with great camera and retina display. Even amazon is a safe place to purchase costly things. Just got my gold iPhone 5s frome amazon in awsome condition ðŸ‘?ðŸ?»ðŸ˜„

Beautifully designed, smooth OS and imaginatively simple navigation. Love the security and consistency of the finger-print scanner. Wish the battery life was longer though.

bought 32 GB model. After using iPhone 6 for a month, I switched to 5s. This is the best premium phone in the market if one handed use is one of your criteria. I couldn't get used to large screen of iPhone 6 as it impaired one handed usability which has always been very  important for me. I find the 4&#34; screen perfect for my use. And it isn't too small to watch a video or play a game. If you are fond of large screens, don't go for 5S. As for performance, it is almost as fast as iPhone 6 to handle your daily usage. I don't play graphically intensive games which probably would be more fluid on iPhone 6. But otherwise, it is lagfree phone. Don't compare specs of iPhone with Android as iOS is built on a different platform. Dual core processor and 1 GB RAM on iOS would give you a better user experience than most android phones with much higher specs.<br /><br />Another big reason to buy this phone is the price of 32 GB version. 16GB isn't just enough for anybody I guess. iPhone 5s 32 GB is &#62; 15K cheaper than iPhone 6 64 GB.

Have been using this phone for almost an year.<br /><br />I will recommend this phone to anyone looking for a small and fast phone. The phone is handy for one-handed usage. Just slips inside my pocket easily and very easy to operate.<br /><br />Back camera is excellent and very fast. No complains. Front cam needs improvement though. Still, its above average.<br /><br />Battery life is also decent. You can get through one full working day easily. Phone has only ~1500 mah battery which means it charges even from USB ports of laptops/PC unlike iPads/Samsung phones.<br /><br />Only downside is the charging port, if you forget your charger, its going to be difficult because remaining all phones use micro-USB.<br /><br />Overall Excellent Phone. If you want to upgrade from older large screen phone, it may take sometime to get used to the screen size.

First of all, i wanted to say thanks to Amazon. I am a great fan of this site, their management of products and customer service is truly awesome.<br />Now coming to the my iphone, what can i say when the name itself hold all description and uniqueness of the product. I am just loving it, I have used android phones, windows phones but iphone is the best.<br />-The processing speed is to fast, you will definitely enjoy.<br />-The 8 MP camera really rocks, i have not expected such crystal clarity, and most importantly, we can take pictures fraction of seconds, one after another.<br />-Lookwise iphone 5S is the best among all the iphones. :)<br />-Last but not the least Siri is also another feature which makes iphone unique<br /><br />I would like to say, iphone 5S is truly made for professionals..

Phone is Simply awesome with good battery life and a decent performance. Previously i was using an Android phone and after my new iPad i wanted to buy apple devices just for its simple and wonderful performance.<br />Liking it very much.People may say Apps are costly Itunes only provide music and videos bla bla bla...Now its much improved.I m using all free Apps which is good enough for day to day needs and the Apps are Well customized to the device.( In Android many devices are there so it is quite tough to customize the app to perform well for all the devices exist in the market.)<br />Ultimately without doubts u can buy it. It returns u in performance,for whatever u paid for it.<br /><br />Pls dont forget to register ur product with apple to ensure the originality of the product.

I was an android guy all this while, finally switched over to an iPhone. The iPhone 5s is still an lovely phone. Does its job extremely well and is a joy to use. Processor speeds and ram etc are a thing of the past and just marketing jargon. 1gb ram on this baby and she does not skip a page. That's design and efficiency in perfect harmony. One handed use of a phone is critical. Trust me I've owned a note a nexus etc. this screen size works brilliantly. That's where the iPhone 6 lost out for me and I have big hands. A 4&#34; iPhone 6 and I will consider it. At this price nothing comes close.<br /><br />The seller was prompt in delivery. Arrived in a day an packed well. The warranty is valid. Over a good experience.

Worst worst worst, poor poor poor, disappointing, bull s***...<br /><br />Defective phone was sold to me, poorest service by Amazon.

The iPhone was delivered promptly and in good condition in 5 days flat as promised. I am not an iPhone fan but my son is. Got him a 5 S as his 4S went dead after 2 years of rough use .  I have never seen a more damaged phone than the old 4s which suffered several screen cracks, software reloads etc.  I don't know what Apple does but seeing my son's inexplicable loyalty, even after knowing the advantages of a 5 inch screen,  to the 4 inch screen on iPhone 5s obviously means that Apple has something which is attractive. I am a Samsung fan and use a Note 4 which is far far ahead of the iPhone 5 S for same price... Well it takes all sorts to make a world. Anyway enjoying my son going gaga over the iPhone 5 S.

Everything's great - working as expected. The screen resolution is a big step up from my older iPhone 4. I'm not a phone buff, so I don't have to have the latest gadgets, but as far as a regular phone functions, its great. I also have a few movies downloaded on my phone, from my iTunes account... It's great to have the 32 GB.. My iPhone 4 had a lower storage, and I had to constantly delete videos and photographs to make more space. Now I have so much space for many photographs and songs. I'm very happy - it meets my needs - some browsing, a few apps, music and camera - the camera is pretty good too. Not as great as the iPhone 6, but good enough. I got it at a great price - reduced, which is great.

I was very skeptical before using an iPhone but let me tell you they are the best devices made on earth. iPhone is an experience, you can't define it<br />Let there be thousands of other flagship phones with more RAM, ppi, etc. the hardware offered in the iPhone is more than capable of lasting for more than 5 years of heavy usage. The software is still far behind as compared to android when user friendliness is taken into account.<br />The quality of the accessories provided in the box is debatable. I have already replaced my charger cable twice due to breakage.<br />Seeing the heads turn when you hold an iPhone is simply amazing.

Ordered twice from Cloudtail and both times disappointed, therefore returned. Poor battery life and wifi connectivity. Dull and yellowish display. My iPhone 4 works much better than this.<br />DONT BUY FROM CLOUDTAIL!!<br /><br />Waiting for the other seller to reduce price.<br />Attached: Difference in display of iPhone 4 and iPhone 5s (taller).

IPhone 5s does not need a reveiw, all I'll talk about is amazon and it's vendors.<br />Order from seller gabbardeals.com if there is not much price diff from other sellers.<br />Never every buy from Gadget Direct, they are not worth it, they don't respect there customer, the product was super delayed, was meant as a gift for somebody on his b'day, while placing the order the estimated deliver date was 11th October, b'day was 13th, I received the phone on 14th, that too after chasing them and following them like crAzy!<br />Order was placed on 6th October, who in the world waits so much for a new phone?<br />They have no courtesy at all, say big no to Gadget direct, and make sure your product is sent by Amazon Transport Service and not by blue dart, blue dart, was the courier company which delayed the product.<br /><br />About phone a brief!<br />Price: 34,240 and 34,282 (5th and 6th October 2014)<br />Features: best in class<br />Touch: superb<br />Touch ID/fingerprint scan: far better than expected.<br />Battery is really nice as compared to Samsung and other androids.<br />Online Video streaming is amazing.<br />Phone is a value for money.<br />Max price to buy this phone should not be more than 38k.

The iPhone received was faulty. Its no good if you offer cheap price but a faulty product.

The best ever device you can hold<br />Wel, there are 2 things in this world  1 is mass and other is class<br />Apple iPhone is the class product. Rhisi s the only phone which if you buy it is going to last until you decide to retire. I her than iPhone no phone lasts longer than 1.5 ye max android phones crashes have a lot but have never seen an iPhone crashes this is an investment while other phones are expenses<br />Kudos k apple for creating such amazing product. It's acceasibilty and user friendliness is fantastic performance gaming display operation evening rocks

Seller is awesome! Ordered the phone on FEB-25 and got it on 26. Genuine Product.Model A-1530 - compatible with India LTE band and has One year warranty.<br />I was and Andriod user for 3 years. Got fed up with the Lolipop update. It made my phone (Moto g 1st Gen) slower.Hence went for the iphone.<br /><br />Pros:<br />App interface is different from Android, its simple.<br />Camera is awesome<br />Standby time is really awesome!<br />you wont be disappointed.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Compared to Android it is IOS is little restricted :) , you will get used to it<br />itunes is something which I am still getting used to.<br />Its does get heated up after heavy usage, which is normal with any product.Since it is a metal body the intensity is slightly more. It also depends on the room temp.<br />Battery life: it varies from 4hrs to 10hrs depending on how heavy the usage is. There are days when I have got it for 17hrs as well. Don't worry about it.

Earlier I used to think why people use to spend 40k-45k just for a 5-inch mobile phone..But using for about 1 month, I found the reason behind that. I liked the shape and design, metallic back panel especially, its OS and display, feature of touch ID and facetime, front HD camera. Now I think I've wasted 4 years using Android. A must buy for those, who just not use their phones but love them.

If i have to describe it in a single word then it's &#34;Awesome&#34; in each and every aspect. Its fast, got a premium look, light in weight & and most of the all it's pocket-able....

I purchased this phone from amazon through cloud tail retailer. And at first I was little hesitant about warranty issue, but the phone I received was genuine and brand new with full warranty.

I have ordered for a iPhone 5s 16 GB Space grey I was informed that  it will take 4-7days for delivery. But to my surprise the item was at my door step in less than 48 hours though I am residing some 1000 kms away from origin of shipment. The item is a brand new, Factory sealed Box with all accessories as mentioned  and on online verification with Apple Co. the phone is to be activated thus confirming its genuineness.

Awesome product from Apple ever. I had purchased this product from Amazon to add upto my apple environment at home. At first I was little worried whether to purchase it from e-retail store or from some offline store as most of the e-comm websites including Amazon did not mention anything about 4G support which is the main reason I am upgrading from Samsung S4. Since I found a great deal from Amazon I booked it on the night of January 25th. Then I had sent my query to Cloudtail, who is the selling this product in Amazon. Amazing thing is I got an instant reply from the Cloudtail about its 4G compatibility. I got the product delivered to me on January 26th Morning even though I did not opt for express service. The product is 100% genuine apple iPhone. It is imported version and it is compatible to Airtel 4G LTE services. As Airtel uses 2300Mz range for 4G services or Band-40. Most of the imported phones especially imported from US are not supported in India 4G services.<br /><br />Thanks for Amazon for providing me best deal and amazing experience.

Right after receiving the product you can check if the product is genuine or fake just goto https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do and enter serial number of your iphone if u are doing above procedure before even switching on your iphone they it will give a msg &#34;No details for the above product found&#34; else it will show you today's date and under one year of warranty.

Wow. Worthy. Solid. Hot. Sexy. Beast. Hardcore Phone.

I5s is the best phone in the market, this I agree now. Only when you buy an apple device then only you realise why it's so much better than android or the stylish Windows phone. It's simply brilliant. Easy to use, superbly customised and a lavish look. This space grey model is more attractive.<br />Plus, amazon does a great job.<br />Full deserving 5stars for a wonderful product! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

I will not post a review about the phone since the whole lot of customers and the experts  have already done that. Instead I will stick with the basics, item was received in perfect condition. No issues so far. I have been using it for more than 6 months now. Seller is genuine, shipping was fast and yes I have warranty .

Don't buy from this seller. Purchased iPhone 5s. Few days back while charging, it's cord had short circuit. I took the phone to authorised Apple centre, to my horror I was told, the cord and the adopter was duplicate not original.

Great product, amazing buying experience with amazon. Amazon rocks!!!! Far better than Flipkart or any other online portal, keep it up.

Hi.<br />After using it for 1 week.<br />I don't think it's wise to spend 30 k on this product. The phone heats up quite easily. You can iron a cloth. Battery back up is horrible. With 3/4G on it can hardly last for more than 5 hrs. Not recommended.<br />God knows what for people appreciate this phone so much.

product was 100% as per the seller and clarified all my doubt.<br />Great seller to have a great deal

Awesome delivery. The phone is cent percent original. Its been one month I've been using the phone and its working perfectly. The warranty is provided aa promised. Highly recommended, Don't worry just make the purchase. I purchased from cloudretail when The price was 36k

I ordered iphone 5s from amazon but I am very dissatisfied, its not even 6 months and the charger of the phone is already not working. Also, I have started experiencing that my phone has started hanging. With all these experiences I am expecting it to be a fake product.

I have purchased in i-phone 5S 16GB Gold on Sept 14, 2014, which was received by me on 17/9/2014. The phone was a brand new sealed piece with all accessories were intact inside the cover. However, the phone started showing trouble from 23/9/2014 with 2/3rd of screen having dim and obstructed view with lines and strips on display. I have to carry the phone at service center on 27th Sept 2014, which has registered my complain and on 6th Oct 2014 they have replaced the faulty handset with a brand new one. I am giving 'three star' as the phone had troubled me within 10 days of my purchase from amazon. However, it is also true that the seller as well as amazon may not have been in default as the problem may be a manufacturing defect and therefore giving them a benefit of doubt. It is also true that apple acknowledges all purchases from amazon and treat all defects covered as per manufacturing warranty. Hence No complaint.

Well I don't feel one need to even utter a word about iPhone 5s. The name itself speaks for itself. Its been nearly 2 months that I had been using this phone and believe me people there is not single sign of lag or heating even with more than 7 apps running in the background. Its the best phone available in the market even when i know iPhone 6 will be coming to india sooner than later. But considering the price at which it is trading right now IT is the BEST BUY.<br />About the seller the product is 100% genuine. I had even checked the warranty status on the apple self solve website. Thanks for such a nice experience.

Worst product... Plz dont buy this phone from Amazon i just bought 10 days before it is a total waste Amazon gave me a defective product..... Now am running behind amazon for replacement and they are not giving me  a correcr solution  :( :(

its my first iphone.writing this review after using it for 5 months.i have been an old android user from the beginning.<br />full marks from my side to apple for creating such a beauty 5/5 sturdy build and sleek metal adds up to its charm.<br />Coming to the interface ios is bit restrictive than android but it has its own pros and cons.i really liked it very simple and easy to use no hassles.<br />Screen size is perfect for me easy to handle.<br />Got the cashback gift card as promised bu the seller and amazon.<br />Heating issues in the beginning contacted apple care and voila working perfectly since then.at last,amazon is the right place to buy it.go for it blindfolded :p



The price for iPhone 5s golg 16gb went to as low as 27500. So its not worth to buy at current price as it will go down even more and with 6s just around the corner to release in india,  it going to be a huge price correction

After Using for about 5 months<br />This device has never let me down<br />If any android user compare your phone and says about Dual Core processor Show him the Antutu benchmark<br />Its amazing it crosses Xperia Z2, Samsung Galaxy S5 so the dual core is better than other octa core due to the fact that the chipset is A7 which makes efficient working and 64bit processor leaves both these competitors behind<br />Again Camera is excellent Chrome mode is excellent<br />Amazon is just amazing i got this phone for 35999â‚¹ which was really a steal

Price is too high when compared to ebay,reduce the price amazon.in<br /><br />http://www.ebay.in/itm/Apple-iPhone-5s-16-GB-GSM-Mobile-Phone-Silver-Phone-comes-Demo-content-/271992268210?aff_source=mysmartprice

best buy. just awesome. delivery was on time.  the iphone 5s is a wonderful and simple phone. looks executive and is not bulky or oversized. im very happy i bought this instead of the samsung note 3 or s5.

A great product and all in all a satisfactory purchase. Though it was my first major and an expensive purchase I am glad it all went well. It is a great bargain compared to the market rate which is 10,000 rupees more than the price I paid while purchasing it from here.<br />Satisfied and happy to the core with the product.

i have received product i am not comfortable with product & packing

Loved this Iphone 5s which i received on last week of JAN<br />After using for 3-4 months i m writing that im really happy with this as i received a brand new sealed box with the phone which was not activated as checked from apple site.<br />Though i had an issue of call drops from the very first day which was rare but i was happy that when i took this to Apple service centre they diagnosed and gave me a brand new non actvated phone again after they confirmed the issue<br />Go for it as i paid 40k and got 8k amazon gift card so it costed me 32.5 aprx so the best deal one can get for Iphone

This is my first purchase through Amazon India online and I must say I'm absolutely impressed. The phone is simply awesome and Amazon's service is amazing. Keep it up guys. Very satisfied. Thanks!

I want to know that when should i get my money back of promotional of rs 4600..its being 3 month..i purshased feom ur cloudtail bcz i find the deal good but why you are delaying in my gift card..

It was a pleasant move from Samsung Galaxy to apple iphone. Fully satisfied. Power adaptor got faulty in few days but apple support replaced it without any question. Thanks amazon and cloudtail.

Best phone in market!!<br />Bought it from Amazon, delivery was lil disappointing but at the end i got my phone before the time they committed. Just one little concern, when i searched warranty details through my IMEI number, it says my warranty is till 2nd Sep 2015 however i received my phone today i.e. 10th October. I guess i have to approach customer service in Amazon for this issue.

I bought this as deal of the day. The seller and amazon did an awesome job to make this deal successful.<br />Regarding phone..... Oh its so good. I am impressed with the performance.

To start with, the offer was great and very enticing! I found it for the lowest price here on Amazon. The delivery was prompt. The product is superb! Loved the whole experience.

I received the phone on time, Thanks Amazon.<br /><br />Very first thing after getting phone I checked the warranty period and it was exactly one year, so rumors regarding warranty were false.<br /><br />Product wise, its being a month I am using, and no problem faced till now. Apple is always best in product quality.<br /><br />Completely satisfied with product and amazon service. 5 start.

Talking about the positives of this phone is not necessary because most people already know it! The phone was in good condition,the delivery was prompt,no hassles..<br />the gold iphone has a sexy look to it and at just 38K it was more than just worth it! This phone is for folks who just wanna get their work done without any issues or delay! If you want 100 latest features as and when they come,you need an android device but if you want the relatively new features to work 100% without fail or any glitches ios devices wont disappoint you!

Absolutely great deal, amazing phone at this price range.

There is something a prospective buyer should understand before even looking to buy an iphone 5s.<br />I'm no apple fanboy, trust me, but it IS the best phone available on market right now.<br />Not the most value for money, but the ultimate best. The Primera.<br /><br />Looks wise, I'd say its not a bad job. The same signature look that it has carried on since long. The gold and gray look fantastic, and feels nice in hand as well. But looks aren't even the intro to the whole story.<br /><br />The A7 chip inside is the best processor available on market for mobile devices, even better than the top of the line SnapDragon 800 which is the best any android/windows phone can offer.<br />The performance gains are not significant enough to matter to a casual user, or any user unless you were really looking for it. Its like saying ones a lockhead blackbird and others a falcon htv2. FYI, they're both insanely fast aircrafts. For people like us, its insignificant which is really faster. The 64bit architecture wouldnt matter much to the normal user as long as the applications dont make use of it. Its just apple being paranoid as usual about being future proof.<br />In addition to the processor capabilities, a major plus of Apple devices is that iOS7 was optimized for A7, while android(kitkat or jbean or whatever) is not. Android runs on a vm which leeches out a bit of the potency.<br />The GPU performance is commendable, and the motion processor m7 is also a unique characteristic, though if its full potential can be used in normal scenario remains to be seen. Yet.<br />The fingerprint scanner is a new innovation, and seems to work pretty good unless your hands are too sweaty. Currently its use is limited though in time in-app authentication as well as credit card/bank acc/wallet authentication could also be done using it. Lots to look forward to.<br /><br />Downsides are also there, iOS7 needs more optimization to be better. And some might prefer a bigger screen to utilize all that juice inside. Though IMO the size seems optimum, not too big for a phone, and not too small to be disappointed. The battery could be a bit improved too, to last more than a day. A7/M7/PowerVR6 does drink a lot of power.<br /><br />All in all, I5s is not your casual whip-it-out-of-the-pocket-and-throw-it-to-the-bed smartphone, its a carefully constructed marvel. Powerful, future proof upto maybe 2+years, which is not something any other phone can boast about. Only two things stand in the way of it being the optimum phone, 1st being on the higher side of the food chain, and 2nd the more important one, we dont need that much power or performance. Yet. The app ecosystem, however large and varied it is, still doesnt have any applications that make use of the a7/m7 processors inside, or the 64bit architecture for that matter. And without it, its just a lamborghini on indian roads. Still, It IS the most expensive phone on the market. And again, it IS better than any, and you don't get to be the best without beating the best, and it costs to do that, like, a LOT.<br /><br />Build Quality: Unmatched (The closest competitor would be the HTC One)<br /><br />Display: Many people complain that this 4-inch retina display offering is joke when compared to what other manufacturers offer these days. But this is not a phablet; it's comparatively much easier to use with one hand and the color tone of the 5S is much better than the overly saturated displays on the Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Note 3.<br /><br />Processor and RAM: The 5S has only 1GB RAM and a Dual Core processor which seemingly pales in comparison to what other flagship phones have to offer. But if you are a serious buyer, don't be fooled by these specs because the iPhone 5S is actually &#34;The Fastest Phone ever tested&#34; till date. The reason why the iPhone 5S blows away the competition is because it's processor is made specifically for the phone and it utilizes and squeezes processing power in the most efficient way unlike other phones whose processors are generic and used across various manufacturers without really utilizing available power to it's full extent.<br /><br />Camera: The 5S has a excellent camera but it is not the best in the market.<br /><br />Call Quality: Normal calls are just as good as any other phone. But not many people are aware of the new facetime audio HD calling feature across iOS 7 users, the clarity is almost too much! You can even hear a person swallow or smack his/her lips. Little too intimate if you ask me :-)<br /><br />Special Feature: Fingerprint Scan and unlock your phone. People may argue over the pros and cons of such a feature but I would personally prefer such a feature which I will certainly make use of; instead of an almost useless fancy feature which I rarely use. (Eg: Touch to share)<br /><br />Price: Considering that the manufacturing cost of the iPhone 5S is just one dollar more than that of the iPhone 5 whose manufacturing cost is around INR 13,000; I would have liked the 5S to be priced at 40,000. It is without doubt EXPENSIVE!

Iam really afraid after Ordered because I have read allot of bad reviews from here about phone !!<br />But When I gt that It was fully sealed pack and genuine product , am using this from last 2 weeks ! It's awesome, worth buy , mind blowing performance<br /><br />For me<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good performance<br />Nice battery performance<br />Great UI<br />Touch ID<br />Music ( both headsets and inbuilt speakers)<br /><br />Cons :<br />Call records apps are not available in AppStore<br />Need to use any cloud for file sharing

To Whom it may be concern!!!<br /><br />Dear Team,<br /><br />I bought this device on 12th May 2015 & consignment was delivered on 15th May 2015, It is now 10 days & the device is heating up badly and consuming battery a lot i.e. battery back-up is low.<br /><br />Please let me know what to do.<br /><br />I think the device is a DOA product & wanted to replace with a Box Pack handset.<br /><br />PS: I am also looking for a theft, physical damage insurance. In case if amazon is supporting with such facilities do let me know.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Surya Kant<br />+91 9971122782

It was an awesome delivery by amazon and a nice product

despite many complaints...amazon.in. loses its standard  by sending high end products in cheap card board wraps...very very angry and disgusted..i guess no one listens

There is no doubt that iphone 5s is a very good phone. Be aware that apple doesn't repair, only replaces the product at a price. So if you cause damage to the phone, be ready to shell out really high price.<br /><br />Each apple product I've used in last so many years has always provided better user experience.<br /><br />However, others have caught up, mainly Moto-G/X and Microsoft lumia seems to be a good alternative for a much much lower price. They too have pretty much the app base you'd need for regular use.

Ekkk Numberrr..!!

A device that can change the myth of a power-house CPU, jumbo RAM & additional storage space. Apple 5S takes your imagination to next level and shows how an OS and carefully selected hardware can prove to be 5times better than their competition. It ensures that my next phone and thereafter would be Apple only :-)<br /><br />Delivery & service by Amazon has been amazing (as always). No wonder how they delivered the phone right on time even when I placed order little out of required time. Thumbs up to Amazon!

It is surprising, before opening the details-it shows the price28000 and after opening the product details or becomes 33000 rs! What is the explanation for 5000 rs?

Really unbeatable processor and OS, well come to the seller, item delivered before delivery date.<br />Iphone was sealed. Genuine product.<br /><br />Recommended

Shall I review the product here? No! let me just clarify question I faced while purchasing. Do I get the warranty? Very much yes.. Although Amazon isn't authorized re-seller of Apple products;still we get full one year warranty starting from the day of activation. Delivery was well within the committed time period. And product is heavenly! guys you will feel it when you hold it in your hand. Pretty much snappy. And does all the tasks a smartphone is required to do pretty smoothly without any lag..

Over a month i had waited to see how really iphone works. Its the Best phone ever had till now after using different phones from decade now. battery get charged up quickly in less than 2 hrs 0-100% and than doesnt drain as quickly as other fons i used to use No*** or the phathetic Sum****. Were they will hang, battery will dry i furst half of day. hated it 2hen this happend.<br /><br />Giving 4 stars because of snaps quality. This could have been better.<br /><br />Rest this is worth all money...

Awsomeness is having this phone .<br />I baught it from Amazon last week, it works just above the brilliant.<br />It radiates the motivatio  when u carry it..wow..camera quality : more than awesome, one can capture the birds eye view :)<br />As one of my friend noticed it, immediately he ordered 2 phones from Amazon itself, and got it delivered very next day.<br />Overall the phone is superb, it worths paying .<br />Not even a single technical fault.<br />Resplendent look, I strongly recommend.

When we buy an iPhone we know what we want and are getting, so I'll keep my review focused on the Amazon.in product experience as that's what most people are concerned about (for Amazon fulfilled iPhone, for something so expensive unless it's from Croma etc, going for anything not Amazon fulfilled isn't wise!).<br /><br />- Product was from Apple India, and imported about two months prior to my purchase, with all relevant stickers and packaging intact. Both external and internal packing appeared to be original with no tampering.<br />- Product was not registered currently to anyone, a check on Apple's warranty checker allowed me to verify that.<br />- Was able to register the phone through iTunes and immediate warranty activation happened, and a check on Apple's warranty checker allowed me to do that.<br />- Pre-installed OS was iOS 8.1 (for a Jan15 manufactured device)<br />- Did a recall check, and according to the Apple site this Serial number did not have those defects (battery, sleep/wake button) that impacted devices from last year<br />- Delivery (in Metro) under 48 hours including a Sunday<br />- As I was changing my phone from iPhone 4 to iPhone 5s, I had to get a nano SIM to replace my micro SIM (four hour activation process)<br />- Seamless data backup and restore from my old phone running iOS7 running iOS 7.1.2 to this<br />- For the first hour or so, there was a lot of heat from the back of the phone compared to my iPhone 4 and I was wondering if that was normal, but that problem went away.<br />- Tax invoice came with delivery, seller on Amazon.in was Gadgetdirect

I am not a huge apple fan but I must say that they have done outstanding work making this phone.<br /><br />I suppose anyone reading through the reviews and actually looking to buy the phone needs to here pros for this piece. So here, I will point out the possible cons which I felt I should have known earlier -<br /><br />1. The piece came without the seal cover, however the warranty was intact and as far as I could tell the piece was not used earlier.<br />2. 5s uses a nano (not micro) SIM card which may be a troublesome task to get due to long queues at service stores and especially so if you are do not have a spare/second SIM/number<br />3. Battery drain is quite fast while you are using camera or watching videos and it does get heated up after a while of heavy usage<br />4. If you are switching from android, be prepared for the frustration that comes with finding out a way to transfer your contacts<br />5. Apps - notification system and actual apps uses different ways to fetch the data so apps like gmail or whatsapp will show you notifications but it will take a while for you to get the message on your app once you open it<br />6. Left side of the In-built speakers at the bottom of the phone is useless, if you cover the right side the phone will go silent. Check this out on youtube if you like.<br /><br />Despite all of this, its a phone worth going for. I received the delivery in 3 days which was okay for me.

At first, I was a bit apprehensive of buying a product this expensive from online. But after it got delivered and using it for 5 days, I am happy about my decision of buying from Amazon and secondly going for the best smartphone in the market.<br /><br />My first moment of truth was with the delivery time, the courier was delivered two days ahead that too in Cochin. Second is with the quality and the usability aspect of iPhone 5S.<br /><br />The best thing I love with iPhone 5S are:<br /><br />- The simplicity of the user interface.<br /><br />- The super smooth response. I was taken away by how fast the iOS 7 responded, even though more than a dozen applications where running in the background; to name a few - Viber, WhatsApp, Google Chrome, Mail, Safari, Facebook, Twitter, iCloud backup and many more<br /><br />- Build quality is superb, with the metal casing. I would say, one should feel it yourself by holding it in your hand<br /><br />- The size of the phone is well balanced, its neither too big to fit in my palm nor too small when it comes to screen size; moreover, it fits well in my shirts and trousers pocket.<br /><br />- When it comes to security, iPhone stands out from the crowd. This stems from the fact that, Apple's iPhone and iPad have the widest adoption in the enterprise. For me this is all about peace of mind, as I don't have to think twice before installing an App.<br /><br />- Biometric authentication, a nifty feature which I love the most. Now, I no longer need to memorize unlock codes nor patters to unlock the phone. With this, unlocking the device and making purchases from App store is a breeze, by pressing the finger on the home button.<br /><br />The features I wished to have with iPhone are:<br /><br />- An elegant way to migrate contacts, calendars, notes, reminder and data from other models. It was an ordeal for me getting the data migrated from old phone.<br /><br />- Battery backup could have been made better, while 3G is on. For me it lasts only up to 8 to 9 hrs<br /><br />For me, initially iPhone 5S wasn't on my radar, predominantly because of its heavy price tag. But with the launch of iPhone 6, prices have come down to a level, which is affordable enough for those looking in the 30K - 40K price range.<br /><br />Anyhow thanks to Amazon and &#34;Lion Deals&#34; for the great online shopping experience.

Finally got iphone 5s gold. I want this iphone nd finally made decision to buy it and got it from amazon in Rs34599/-. This phone believe me was an awesome phone and will overcome all ur expectations. I was confused tht i should buy this since iphone 6 was out but decided to go for 5s since i dont like the iphone 6 very much. Iphone 6 belive its not look like an apple flagship phone. I was really happy with iphone 5s. If u want an apple phone then 5s will make ur dream come true!!

Its my first iPhone and second Apple device. I use iOS since 5th version and I waited 6 months to write this review.<br />I don't want to go on and on and explain everything but I would never go back to any other phone manufacturer as long as Apple is surviving.<br />Bottom line, 64bit and Touch ID are first introduced with this phone so better buy this if you are budget concerned instead of 6 or 6+ or for that matter 5c or below.<br /><br />Had no issues with shipping or product.

Without doubt a gorgeous phone, beautifully crafted by the master craftsman Apple. Its superfast , supersmooth and a fabulous assistant to your daily needs. Shifting after a two year stint with the android , the two things that I miss most in Apple is the FM radio and the bluetooth functionality to exchange files. But there are a host of other unique features in Apple that will shadow the misses of an android phone.It is a fabulous piece of technology and will not let you down.

This phone has some bettry issue, dont knw why, its genuine piece but really havin bettry trouble

Checked Online about warranty and product at Apple Online Warranty Check..!!<br />Packed properly and delivered on time with original and genuine product.<br />I was little bit afraid before product delivery and on time of purchasing because the Purchasing rate is very lower then retail market ..<br />But nw i m completely satisfied with the product,its warranty,timely delivery,genuine accessories with bill and sealed iphone 5s.<br />Thanx Cloudtail for making my trust on online shopping..!!

Hi guys,<br />Rocking commitment and delivery from Amazon I ordered for the iPhone 5s on 28 mar Mng 8am I received the product on same day. Kudos for Amazon for delivering on time.....<br />So far the product is concern over all performance is good. Head phones are awesom but Apple R&D should play a great role to improve the battery backup considering Indian networks and coverage.<br />Only concern is battery back up, easily getting drained by frequent searches of network....

It took 10 days for delivery of this product after placing my order, then i checked for the authentication it was an unlock phone and the Product Description were matching but what i want to tell is this, this  product doesn't deserve that much of price because there is nothing Woow or Amazing in this product u can get the same specification with a little bit of less price and its very restrictive but If u r a crazy iphone fan then nothing is better then this just go for IT.

Its been 3months that I had been using the apple iphone 5s gold which i brought from amazon.First of all let me tell about the delivery and customer care.It had been great .Now let me come to the phone.Its one of the best no doubt.Though the price is little higher but after all its apple .I had been passionate about apple products and  this is one brilliant piece of innovation from Apple.Look and feel is as usual good and sleek.Speed is also appreciable.Overall a good buy .

as of this writing, this is a steal deal, 32Gb model is cheaper than 16Gb model....<br /><br />Unbelievable, thanks to amazon. bought this model @40k

Great phone. I used it for a month. If you dont care about your budget and want to get a phone which you find great then go for it.<br />Pros:<br />1. Well designed nody structure.<br />2. Great performance.<br />3. Smooth touch with very good interact.<br />4. Censors in the phone is great.<br />5. Good for gaming purpose aswell.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> None...( I did'nt find any negative in this phone. Maybe others may have it.)<br />My suggestion is go for it...

Giving feedback after using iPhone 5S last 25 days. I ordered this phone on Amazon Diwali Dhamaka deal @ 29999. I got amazing deal with best price. It is brand new genuine apple iPhone in sealed box with accessories having apple India warranty. I did not have any problem till date.

Brilliant Phone, working very well. Apple's quality and precision is spot on. At times tho, people on the other end of the voice line complain that the voice isn't very audible. Don't know if this is a general issue or specific to this particular instrument. Features may be a less than that of an Android at that price, but, well, iOS is way better to use. And yes, this is a perfectly handy size for a phone. It's neither small like a 4S or large like the 6.

Phone Found to be heating Problem while using accessing  3g / Navigating map / enable location track feature<br />Is there any problem Because i have seen the same phone with many of my Friends but comparatively my phone get more heating issue<br />Any Suggestion or solution to the problem ? or Have to satisfy with a bad experience and considered Bad luck<br />I phone 6 has got better battery<br /><br />Only heating issue else I phone has no Comparison

Review on my iPhone-5S :<br />The item got delivered within a day I ordered. Packing was good. Got an original IPhone-5S. Thanks Amazon.<br />Specification Review :<br />Camera is great.<br />Model received was A1530, which supports Airtel 4G in India. Phone gets heated only when we continuously try to use 4G internet.<br />With full day on 4G internet, the battery comes for 8 hours.<br /><br />Overall, I am satisfied. Thanks Apple and Thanks Amazon

Awesome phone!!! must buy. iOS 9 makes it even more special! its very handy and fast. 16GB is enough for me because i dont listen to songs much.looks and feels awesome! Its an assistant in your pocket!!! You wont regret buying it!<br />As a matter of fact, ShareIt app allows you to transfer stuff to and from android phones. no worries there. Battery backup I feel is good enough. comes for almost the whole day for me. Buy it no matter what!!!

I received this phone on the 24/5/2015. I was very excited but just after 3 days of usage the phone is overheating very quickly and in app sounds have just dissapeared. There is no volume in any of apps but the ringtone and everything are still working. It's overall a superb phone by apple but something faulty with the retailer maybe. I would still recommend this phone but maybe not from Cloudtail. I'm gonna talk to Amazon about this....

I was not able to get any discount on the iPhone 5S from any of the dealers or Apple Authorized Stores which is when I decided to try and see if there was a good deal available online.<br /><br />And boy was I surprised, to find the iPhone 5S available on Amazon at INR 47615, a huge saving on my pocket.....to top it up, being a Citibank Card holder, I am entitled to a cash back of INR 1500....Now thats some deal....Thank you Amazon!

I am using this phone for past 11 months.<br />No performance or mfg issues.<br /><br />You can trust this seller for buying an Iphone.

great delivery.....but packing is not soo good by cloud tail<br />excellent mobile but poor battery backup 100% genuine piece by Amazon

Top notch service by Amazon.Terrific phone with fabulous features and it was well packed.No complaints whatsoever...I am lovinnn it !!!

Apple iPhone 5S is just a GOOD phone. I would have used the word &#34;EXCELLENT&#34; if I would be using the phone in US or UK. Apple products are not meant for Indian market/users. Because Apple has lots of apps available in App Store but most of them are restricted for India or paid one. Not very useful pre-installed apps out of the box. You have to buy most of the useful apps from App stores.<br /><br />I am giving below TRUE and HONEST feedback after using the phone for a month.<br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Excellent built quality<br />2. Very good design and very flexible to handle in one hand. After all I bought a cell phone not A Tab or Palm top like 5 inch 7 inch phones. A smart phone should be a phone not a Tab or Palm top or mini laptop like others.<br />3. Feeling is very fluid while navigating through different pages.<br />4. Touch ID works very smart and useful.<br />5. Excellent camera quality.<br />6. Owsome display and brightness.<br />7. Sexy and hot look.People look around me while my phone rings and I take it from my pocket to attend the call.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Battery drains very first if simply WiFi is ON, Cellular is ON. I even don't listen a single song in a day, I talk hardly an hour in a day, use max 15 minutes to 30 min Wifi. No 3G connection. All back ground apps are disabled. still then very less battery back up as compared to Nokia Lumia 525 (Previously used), Nokia asha phones etc.<br />2.Most of the apps are paid. No call recording built in Apps. 3rd party call recording apps are paid or not full version.<br />3. No freedom/flexible as like other Android or Windows phone. Not user friendly at all.<br />4. Without iTunes this phone is just a baby's toy. You have to depend only on iTunes though till you use iPhone.<br />5. Bluetooth is of no use.Not able to connect phones other than iPhone/iPad. No file transfer over Bluetooth.<br />6. You have to wait till you get a PC to transfer files or data.<br />7. Built in ringtones damn slow, very bad..You have to install ringtone maker to make customize ringtones. Then you have to convert those MP3 song files to AAC files in iTunes (iPhone doesn't support any other format other than AAC for ringtone) and transfer through iTunes to phone. But you can put any ringtones in Android and Windows phone (Lumia 525).  You can set any song as your ringtone. No phone can be comparable with Nokia(any model) for sound quality and hardware.<br />8. No swipe keyboard for iOS 7. Though available in iOS 8 but you have to install some 3rd party app to get best use of it.<br /><br />Overall, I am not very excited (I am little happy though) after getting the phone as I was before buying the phone. You will lose all your freedom once you start using Apple products. Performance/style/built wise better that any other phone but not flexible, usablity, not user friendly.<br /><br />Not recommended for INDIAN market/users. only meant for style, show off and all.

This phone is a delight. Looks extremely stylish too. The gold is a Matt tone and is not &#34; in your face&#34; kind of a gold tone.

Its a awesome phone.Iphone is truly a phone with a lovely look and feel along with features. I received the phone in perfect condition.

I bought this phone at 32k fro Amazon during the month of September 2014..with everything in place..including the Apple Service..!!

It's the best bet for anyone who wants a future-proof, forward-looking phone that runs an unbeatable array of apps.<br />its superb in all departments , just wish it had 1) extendable storage (micro SD slot ) and an HDMI port (the latter can only be had via an expensive adapter). i also feel battery life is little short for my usage.<br />but i must say it's not a phone it's indeed a iPhone. its an asset worth its price.

product is geniune but poor packing ! i never expect this kind of packing for costly items! any way thanks for the offer thats it!

awful ....will not recommend to anyone...got a defective piece...cant return it after 10 days...Flipkart is far better than amazon

Worlds best cell phone and celler site too..my best deal of iphone5s ..m so lucky that i got this gold bby in just 29999/-<br />Thanks amazon please can you give us such amazing offer again my friends and family is waiting for this offer again to be realse<br />And about cell only one disadvantage like other smart phone this is also getting too warm while using net nd rest of things<br />But al and all best cell phone

Excellent service by Amazon, I am happy.

A very good phone and most importantly handy . can be used with a single hand and doesnt just completely encroach your pocket . Apps are really good even the free ones . 16 GB though will make you worried with every additional app as 12.1 GB is available . also for jailbreak freaks install BioLockdown and Airblue to enjoy locking apps with fingerprint and bluetooth file transfer . Warning : Jailbreak voids warranty .

iPhone 5S wholesale price is around $300. With import rate and custom duties together $350= 22,000'. Rest goes to importer and amazon. Alibaba is offering this b2b way. But that is too risky to pay someone unknown. This way good. Oh my iPhone is old now lol. I make rough use of it. It's never been like when I bought. Do anything with the iPhone but not jail break..... Anything happens just reset the phone done....

I'm using iPhone 6 as my primary phone. Purchased this beauty to use with my second sim.  IMHO it's still a wonderfully capable phone with premium build quality. It just oozes class in your hand. Actually, side by side with 6 , this one looks more premium as well as solid. Updated to iOS 9 as soon as I received it, and it runs smoothly. Happy that I purchased this phone rather than any android ones as second one.

I got my iPhone 5S from GabbarDeals at lowest price and it's genuine iPhone from Apple.<br />Validated the warranty and service details via Apple server and it's 1 Year!!!<br />No issues with any feature in iPhone. Great call quality, excellent speed, perfect OS(iOS 7.0.5), Better battery back up, nice look and comfort..  Thanks a lot to GabbarDeals and Amazon.in...Keep up the great work!!!!

The condition of phone received was good, however the charger stopped functioning after 2 days. The same needs to be replaced

Awesome.original new phone for best price on India.i only recommend Amazon if someone lookin forward to buy costly gadgets.

When we buy a swiss watch, What we get for such high price is the Quality, Design and Perfection. The same is applied to iPhone.<br /><br />1. I love its design over any other phone.<br />2. UI is so clean, clear and with useful features<br />3. Data/Charging cable that can be used in any direction is a unique feature.<br />4. Fingerprint scanner is faster than my office attendance machine and that too from any angle.<br />5. Exclusive features like Fingerprint and 64 bit Desktop Class processor in which competition is lagging about a year<br />6. 120 fps slo mo is awesome. It replaced old Go Pro camera.<br />7. Dual flash also produce excellent lighting results.<br />8. Airplay offer audiophile quality audio transmission to Airplay speaker.<br />9. M7 sensor help my NIKE+ move app to be more accurate for health tracking.<br /><br />all in all The best phone that i can have

It has been over 3 months since I ordered this and it seems to be flawlessly working without any H/W or S/W issues. Initially I had a scare of purchasing investing so much online for a product like this having fears of getting duped with counterfeit stuff. However, bogus and counterfeit fears have have been sidelined after testing it rigorously for the past 3 months. It was worth the investment.

this prodect is very good.i have got this product for  rs-40335-3.3%cashback i.e rs 39000.<br /><br />you can also buy from cashkaro and save thousands over Internet shopping(amazon, myntra, jabong, snapdeal&many more) .

I have ordered an iPhone it has been delivered with in no time.The phone is just awesome I'm satisfied thank you amazon:)

Packing was good and iphone was in sealed condition but after unboxing i found two little black spots on white bands which is on gold edges of iphoneâ€¦ touch id is giving problem, everytime need to add new fingerprints, gold color of my iphone is very dull and its not same like which is selling in apple stores, its bulky and dull in colorâ€¦ touch screen is not so responsiveâ€¦ battery drain very fastâ€¦ how much cheap in price u get than apple store price but never buy it onlineâ€¦ i feel like that i am using used or refurbished iphoneâ€¦

I got my iPhone 5S from cloudtail at lowest price and it's genuine iPhone from Apple.<br />Validated the warranty and service details via Apple server and it's 1 Year!!!<br />No issues with any feature in iPhone. Great call quality, excellent speed, perfect OS(iOS 7.0.5), Better battery back up, nice look and comfort.. Thanks a lot to GabbarDeals and Amazon.in...Keep up the great work!!!!

at first i thought of returning the product due to some heating issues... but later on i get to know that it is not the product fault, it is apple's mistake to get heat.,. the heating problem is now completely reduced after 3 days. and i am very happy with this product. amazon delivery is also really amazing...:) so, go with apple iphone 5s its absolutely worth more than the price..:)

I was scared to buy,especially this product online , but somehow managed to buy.<br />Finally brought it from Amazon, It was superb packing and the product is awesome.<br />It's beyond my expectations. I am really happy to buy this product.<br />As I haven't used much to write pros and cons. Overall I dint face any problem till now. Hope so in the future.<br /><br />Thank you AMAZON..

good phone, nothing new to tell, whole world knows about it, just that at time of purchase, it was cheapest on amazon

The battery started draining within 4 months after purchasing. Seems apple dumps its rejected products in Amazon.in

Worth paying every penny for this iphone. The seller is doing a fabulous job. I was a android user in the beginning now I started liking Iphone.<br />I am also advising people to go for this product which is reasonable and worth paying for it.<br /><br />Way to go Amazon. Keep the good work going. My sincere thanks to the seller for getting me a iphone for lesser price.

I've always been an android fan.  But iOS 8 has opened the apple operating system so much that I have begun to love it. On top of that the build quality and materials on iPhone 5s ( as on all apple products) is impeachable.  Very satisfied.  iOS was always buttery smooth but now it has become even more prouductive.  Android fans may not feel all that out of place here.

phone is neatly packaged and delivered a little bit late (satisfied with amazon response fully ) so no complaints from amazon team but the phone is getting heating very quickly while playing game of angry birds transformers, it is the only complaint from my side if amazon helps me in this issue i'm very thankful.and thanx for amazon fro their superb customer support.

Very good product and Original.<br />was sold to me at a very competitive price.<br />Kudos to Amazon for everything<br />Extraordinary skills of Amazon in delivering before the promised delivery date is really outstanding and incredible.<br />Very impressed with every aspect of this purchase and recommended Amazon to lot of Friends.<br />Pls keep up the good work.

Amazing product by Apple and Superb delivery by Amazon...bought it on 6th Feb,everything is fine as of now....

The Phone was received in time and was sealed packed and genuine.<br />The 5S is very light compared to its previous models and has a very fast processor.<br />The camera is also much advanced and u can increase the brightness of the picture while taking a pic.<br />The best feature is the finger print lock .<br />Amazon service has always been excellent as usual.

Do i need to review an iphone after 1 year of it s launch, i don't think so. Coming from Note2  to iphone was a different experience for me. big screen to small screen, android to ios it feels a little different and will take time to adjust, but the feeling is good, only thing is less battery backup otherwise no hanging problem like in note 2 even with 1 gb of RAM

Its just a awesome mob.no other mob cant compare with it.Iphone 5s is better than any mob I will say.i even used around 20 above Smartphone but Its something different from others..totally cool after heavy use..battery is higher than my expectation.I brought it in Rs.36000.<br />I am using it since 2 month.Its just awesome mob cant use any other OS mob any more..

I rated 5 star for the iPhone 5s and the amazon service for their excellent service ordered on 04/08/14 and got it on 06/08/14 though the packaging could have been better but there was no bend on the phone box which means while transit it was in first class seat lol. The seller was gabbardeals .<br />Now about the iPhone 5s its the best in term of simplicity and class .the build quality is solid i would say only htc m8 can be compare when it comes to build quality .the colour saturation is of the best unlike samsung amoled display which are over saturated .about the camera 9/10 build 9/10 call quality 9/10 speed 10/10 no lag at all iOS 7 is good and very fluidic and clean and intuitive .I'm telling this on my experience with the phone so any one who would like to buy the iPhone don't hesitate just get it and then you feel it .<br />I'm very satisfied with my new iPhone 5s space grey and now eagerly waiting for iOS 8 .

Excellent Phone!!! Excellent Condition.<br />Came with 8 iOS 8.1.3 preloaded.<br />overall nice experience.

Very happy to recive it. Bought it in Rs. 29990 when it was on offer two month earlier. Working ok till now

Product is original, never opened, and also the last model of the iPhone 5S as well, everything works just great. Regarding amazon, delivery is too fast, they are doing great. Also as committed special offers everything is applied and i have received Rs. 2500 back on my purchase as well.<br /><br />This was my first order, and everything just worked great.
